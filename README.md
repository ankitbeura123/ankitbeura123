# 💫 About Me:
I am Ankit Beura<br>,I am a technology-oriented learner with a strong interest in software development, web design, and applied computing. My work spans programming in Python and JavaScript, building responsive user interfaces with HTML and CSS, and solving practical problems through code. I focus on writing clean, efficient logic and continuously refining layouts, functionality, and performance. I am especially interested in how technology can be designed to be both technically robust and user-centered. My goal is to keep expanding my skills across development, data handling, and system design while building solutions that are practical, scalable, and well-structured.
